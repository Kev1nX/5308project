## Stage 1:
- Single camera, object tracking

## Stage 2:
- Dual camera tracking, velocity and speed calculations based on triangulated position. 

## Stage 3:
- Optional extension: possible position prediction based on velocity and object.

## Stage 4:
- Further extension: low latency prediction (i.e. faster than the average human reaction time of 250ms )
